# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

    Welcome to MechCalendar

  about_second:
    This is a simple website that will help you better
    understand yourself and your feelings. Every day, you
    can visit the site and mark your day as good or bad. In
    this way, you leave a personal history of your life in
    the calendar and how you perceive it. The site compiles
    statistics about your good and bad days, as well as the
    ups and downs over the past month and throughout your
    time using the site.

  about_third:
    We hope that over time, MechCalendar will become a
    valuable source of information about your inner state!
